Perfect, Vrisha 👍 — let’s walk through exactly how you’d set up and push a GitHub Actions workflow using Git Bash. I’ll give you the commands step by step so you can reproduce them on your Windows machine.

🛠 Steps in Git Bash
1. Navigate to your repo
Open Git Bash and move into your project folder:
cd path/to/your/repo


2. Create the workflow directory
GitHub Actions workflows must live inside .github/workflows/.
mkdir -p .github/workflows


3. Create the YAML file
Use nano or vim (or even Notepad if easier). Example with nano:
nano .github/workflows/ci.yml


Paste the workflow content (Node.js example):
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
   branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test


Save and exit (CTRL+O, Enter, CTRL+X in nano).

4. Stage and commit the workflow
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI workflow for build and test"


5. Push to GitHub
git push origin main


This push will trigger the workflow automatically.

📸 Checking the Actions Output
- Screenshots of Actions run (summary + logs).
- Explanation of secrets configuration.

👉 Since you’re comfortable with Python labs too, do you want me to give you the Python version of the workflow commands in Git Bash (with requirements.txt + pytest) so you can choose depending on your assignment?
- Go to your repo on GitHub.
- Logs showing test execution.
- Add a secret (e.g., MY_API_KEY).
- Reference it in YAML:
- name: Run tests with secret


✅ Submission Checklist
- .github/workflows/ci.yml file in repo.

    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}
  env:
  run: npm test
- On GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.
If your test requires sensitive values (API keys, DB passwords):
🔐 Configuring Secrets (if needed)

- Click the Actions tab.
- Logs showing dependency installation.
- You’ll see the workflow run triggered by your push.
